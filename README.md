# ROSbag Cleanup

Idea to concatenate ROS bag files and recode the timing to be continuous.

Refactoring [bagmerge.py](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car/blob/master/image-localization/community-code/roboauto/scripts/bagmerge.py) by [Shin-nn](https://github.com/Shin-nn)

Bagmerge.py merges different topics into one, very useful feature we are not doing this.

## Motivation

Making a blackbox testing suite of ROS Bags for implementation/smoke testing ROS packages.

## Dependencies

`pip install bagpy`
`pip3 install bagpy`
